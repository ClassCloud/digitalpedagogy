## CURATORIAL STATEMENT

REBECCA: Editorial comments by Rebecca Frost Davis are included inline below following "REBECCA:" for each paragraph of feedback. I begin with overall feedback before the curatorial statement, then add more inline comments mostly following the paragraph to which the feedback applies.

REBECCA: This curatorial statement and pedagogical artifacts focuses on how digital pedagogy breaks the boundaries of traditional history pedagogy.  This is an engaging introduction which reads as a manifesto for digital pedagogy in the teaching of history and also conveys a sense of the community of those who practice it.  For your revision, below I suggest some reframing that will move this statement closer to the genre of the other curatorial statements in the collection.  Those changes include tightening up the framing and formalizing the language.  Currently, your introductory essay almost has a stream-of-consciounsess feel (which does pull your reader in), but I find myself wanting more formal signposting. While your statement should hail those who practice digital pedagogy, those who are newcomers might need more of a path in.  You might look at some of the other entries as a model for the genre, e.g., [failure]<https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/keywords/failure.md>, [rhetoric]<https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/keywords/rhetoric.md>, or [video]<https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/keywords/video.md>.

REBECCA: In addition, for final publication, elements of this keyword entry may be accessed as separate units--the curatorial statement and each annotated pedagogical artifact should be able to be ready separately.  In the current form, they are seamlessly integrated.

The essay looms large in the minds of our students as the thing above all else that historians _do_. "How many pages? How many words? How many sources?" They know the game. If it isn't an essay, students balk, students resist. With good reason: the status quo signifier for historical seriousness, for scholarship, is indeed the essay (and its longer cousin, the monograph) (cf Blevins and Mullen 2015, p39). Digital work that transgresses this 'compulsory figure' (O'Donnell, 2012) is only slowly being recognized (Gibbs 2016; Robertson 2016; but see also the posts by Sheila Brennan listed below on reviews of digital work in academic scholarship). Since how we practice our scholarship informs our teaching, this transgression is what marks the difference between a digital pedagogy and mere online learning.  Online education is about the compulsory figures of academia, about recreating a controllable, observable classroom through a system that watches and monitors everything.  Essays are easy to track, easy to turn-it-in. Compulsory figures lend themselves well to instrumentalization. If we think of being a student as a kind of game with a clear end goal in mind (credentialism), then complete the compulsory figures to win.

REBECCA: Your opening paragraph immediately takes on the difference between online teaching and digital pedagogy and clearly lays out the overall theme of your approach to this keyword.


Digital pedagogy by its transgressive nature cannot easily fit inside the systems that manage our learning. A digital pedagogy (however instantiated) pushes beyond compulsory figures and breaks the game, whilst online learning merely reinforces them. Students will understandably resist. But we must make the case, otherwise we risk undermining the very project of the university.

REBECCA: This second paragraph feels incomplete; you might consider starting the seccond paragraph with “Online education is . . .” from paragraph 1 and merging it with what is now the second paragraph. This paragraph could also be developed by expanding on what you mean by “make the case” and “the project of the university."

Here, I have selected artifacts that plot a way forward for expanding the realm of the possible, for showing how an expanded universe of historical writing can be folded into one's digital pedagogy in a way that transgresses the replicated-classroom model of online education.  My vision of what history means as a keyword in digital pedagogy is to remember what the _spirit_ of the essay (_essayer_, to try) entails. It was a public exercise, a kind of dialogue. To write an essay was to sketch out an experience, an argument, a world where things might be different than they are here: that is, a simulation. Simulations and games, playful experiences, in public: digital pedagogy in history expands and reinvents the essay in a form fitting for the age. Indeed, this vision is very public facing and helps to turn our teaching inside-out; the teaching of history becomes a kind of public history in this model.

REBECCA: Can you begin this paragraph with more explicit signposting? You might start with,  “For this keyword, "

REBECCA: Do you need to tell the audience that “essayer” is French? Could you provide a bit more historical context, e.g., when was the essay a public exercise?

REBECCA: Suggested revision: Instead of “that is, a simulation” maybe “In other words, it was a sort of simulation"

REBECCA: You use the game metaphor in two different ways in this statement—in the first paragraph as a simile for following the rules of being a student and in your third paragraph as digital pedagogy's update of the essay.  I think the second use probably has more impact for your curatorial statement, and your reader might be confused by the double use.

REBECCA: After this third paragraph, I was looking for some concrete links to artifacts that exemplify what you mean by simulations, games, and playful experiences.

REBECCA: Can you expand on “public”?  In your artifacts, it is not just public history as a form of public humanities.  It is also the benefits of public as a form of openness—teaching in the open and the benefits that come with it that comes our in your artifacts.  Also, you might consider referencing the keyword Public by Jeff McClurken, https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/keywords/public.md
You might unpack this into two paragraphs.

The artifacts collected below represent key moments/movements/examples that lay a pathway for us to employ this vision of a digital pedagogy of history, whether that teaching takes place in a classroom or in public, online or off. Many universities have a course called the Historian's craft or something similar on the catalogue: so let us stop writing and start crafting. A digital pedagogy is a pedagogy of making, a pedagogy of playing to see what happens next, whether the resulting object is digital or analogue. Digital; digits; fingers; play.

REBECCA: This statement needs a stronger curatorial framing in the second to last paragraph before artifacts.  Here, again, it reads more as a manifesto and less as a curatorial statement

The artifacts are arranged in an order that should facilitate the integration of digital pedagogies into one's teaching and research.

REBECCA: Please expand on your statement that "The artifacts are arranged in an order that should facilitate the integration of digital pedagogies into one's teaching and research.” How so?  Are the first ones a theory of pedagogy and later ones are more concrete examples? Or do they move from beginning to more advanced? It seems like you are getting at your personal definition of digital pedagogy and that the artifacts you chose exemplify aspects of that definition.

REBECCA: Please move paragraph that follows your list artifacts up to this point so that the curatorial statement is a separate unit from the annotated artifacts.  In the final publication, each elements needs to be able to stand alone, especially if remixed by readers.

## CURATED ARTIFACTS

REBECCA: We are spelling it "artifact" rather than "artefact".  I have corrected throughout.

REBECCA: For your artifacts consider that in the final publication, they will be tagged and might be returned by a search without the curatorial statement.  Your annotation should provide enough information that they can be viewed without that context.

## What's Wrong with Writing Essays?
![screenshot](images/history-MarkSample-wrong-with-essays.png)
+ Artifact Type: description of an assignment that imagines 'writing' to be more akin to 'making'
+ Source URL:http://www.samplereality.com/2009/03/12/whats-wrong-with-writing-essays/
+ Artifact Permissions: no license appears.
Copy of the Artifact (in HTML, PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, RTF, MP3, MP4, MOV, PNG, or JPG), if possible
+ Creator and Affiliation: Mark Sample, Davidson College

This piece crystalizes the issue around essays: we are too much concerned with 'form' and forgetting about 'content'. Sample points out that 'text' derives from the Latin 'to weave', and uses that metaphor to suggest expanding the range of possibilities. Accordingly, Sample offers an example of an assignment designed to 'take the words out of writing', a prompt to create an 'abstract mapping' of a videogame's underlying complexity and representation of the world. A similar prompt could be devised for domains beyond the representation of history in videogames, for instance, the organization of an archival fonds.

REBECCA: Can you gloss the term “archival fonds”? It might need some explanation for a more general audience.

REBECCA: I will send you permission form you can use to request permission from Mark.  Alternatively, you might ask him to put a creative commons license on his work.

## The Unessay
![screenshot](images/history-odonnell-unessay.png)
+ Artifact Type: assignment prompt

+ Artifact Permissions: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0
+ Creator and Affiliation: Daniel Paul O'Donnell, University of Lethbridge

This piece similarly documents problems with 'essays' as they have come to be in the modern undergraduate classroom. What's more, it provides a framework for re-situating them as digital pedagogy, returning agency to the student, and an entirely useful set of criteria for assessing work that does not look like traditional forms. The criteria provided can be transformed into a rubric with two criteria, that the work is 'compelling' and 'effective'.

REBECCA: At the beginning, more precise language might situate your reader, e.g., rather than “piece” maybe “assignment prompt".

REBECCA: Can you expand on the need for assessment rubric, again thinking of a newcomer audience which is often challenged by not knowing how to assess digital work?

## Open Notebook History
![screenshot](images/history-wcalebmcdaniel-wiki-screenshot.png)
+ Artifact Type: blog reflection
+ Source Url: http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html
+ Artifact Permissions: CC BY-SA 3.0
+ Creator and Affiliation: W. Caleb McDaniel, Rice University

McDaniel opens a dialogue with proponents of so-called 'open notebook science', and situates it within practices familiar to historians (a process similar to what Chad Black has called, ['Hacking the Papers of You'](https://parezcoydigo.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/the-individual-research-archive-hacking-the-papers-of-you/)). McDaniel argues that we cannot know the full value of what we have until we allow others to see it; if we did so, while the work was in progress, "we also open new avenues of interpretation, uncover new linkages between things we would otherwise have persisted in seeing as unconnected, and create new opportunities for collaboration with fellow travelers." He outlines the use of Gitit, a personal wiki program combined with Git versioning control, for maintaining such a notebook. Gitit has a steep learning curve; others might want to use a combination of text editor and github repository to achieve the same effect.

REBECCA: In your annotation, can you provide more context/framing for the newcomer reader.  Also, rather than extensive quoting, can you summarize? What is McDaniel's ultimate goal with this piece and what could the new practictioner in digital history pedagogy take from it?

## Writing in Public
![screenshot](images/history-moravec-writinginpublic.png)
+ Artifact Type: web page
+ Source Url: http://michellemoravec.com/michelle-moravec/
+ Artifact Permissions: no license provided
+ Creator and Affiliation: Michelle Moravec, Rosemont College

REBECCA: You can use our permission form to request permissions or ask Michelle to specific a creative commons license.

This page is a landing page for Moravec's writing projects; her goal in writing in public is to demystify the processes of academic labour. She situates this goal within her research on women's liberation movements, as part of a tradition of work that breaks down the boundaries between public and private 'to reveal the politics underneath'. Moravec provides links to projects in progress, and projects completed. She uses a combination of google docs, twitter hashtags, and curated shortlinks to keep track of her readers' engagement with her work.

REBECCA: Michelle is a great model of practicing digital pedagogy in history teaching, but the newcomer may not know that.  Can you explicitly lay out how this artifact connects to digital pedagogy and what the reader should take from it? What will students do with it? How does this connect to your theory of digital pedagogy and your criteria for choosing artifacts?

## Who do you think you are?
![screenshot](images/history-cottom-who-do-you-think-you-are.png)
+ Artifact Type: journal article

It can be dangerous when we break down the walls of our teaching and research, and expose these processes to the wider world. In "Who do you think you are?", Tressie McMillan Cottom analyzes the sociology of the performative attention economy of online work. She exposes the ways that if you don't look like a white man online, what can or cannot be done in terms of a public-facing digital work becomes much more complicated and  dangerous. The piece serves as a counterbalance to the artifacts discussed above.

REBECCA: Again, can you explicitly lay out how  this artifact connects to digital pedagogy and what the reader should take from it? What will students do with it? How does this connect to your theory of digital pedagogy and your criteria for choosing artifacts? How does it counterbalance the artifacts discussed above? On what terms?

## Digital Atlas of Egyptian Archaeology (DAEA)
![screenshot](images/history-anthro-class-msu-daea.png)
+ Artifact Type: class project
+ Source Url: https://matrix-msu.github.io/daea/ (Source code at [https://github.com/matrix-msu/daea-fs14](https://github.com/matrix-msu/daea))
+ Artifact Permissions: GNU General Public License
+ Creator and Affiliation: Students in the Fall 2014 semester in the Archaeology of 
Ancient Egypt class (ANP 455) at Michigan State University, led by Ethan Watrall and supported by Brian Geyer. 

The Digital Atlas of Egyptian Archaeology (DAEA) as a work of collaborative scholarship exemplifies many of the ideas that the previous artifacts point towards. Moreover, the act of putting the source code online allows this student scholarship to be leveraged by other students, expanded, and transmogrified. Christina Ross forked this and repurposed it to become a microhistory of St. John's, Newfoundland http://xtina-r.github.io/daea/, which was then repurposed and extended by Rob Blades (in progress: http://pembrokesoundscapes.ca). Ross's version is on the syllabus in Jeffery McClurken's 'Adventures in Digital History'. http://courses.mcclurken.org/adh/syllabus/). The DAEA shows ways that student work can have impact beyond the classroom.

REBECCA: This artifacts exemplifies the impact of open sharing on digital pedagogy.  The forking of the assignment as it is reused by other digital historians is especially powerful. 

## The HeritageJam

Having just gone through its second iteration, the Heritage Jam is an annual two-day event, where participants collaborate to make something along a particular theme, from a particular collection, with a decidedly public-facing inflection. It brings together participants both live (in a kind of camp-out) and online. Aside from the wonderful things participants make, the Jam rules require them to document the _paradata_ that supports the work. The paradata document draws on a long history in archaeological research of visualizations and making (there is an entire subfield, 'experimental archaeology', which has strong affinities to digital humanities pedagogy and deformance) as codified in the 2009 London Charter of Heritage Visualization (http://www.londoncharter.org/) . Paradata "provide the space through which we communicate ambiguity and transparency, and account for our practices". In this way, the viewers learn how to think critically about the construction of the past.

REBECCA: The paradata is an important aspect of this kind of work; your minecrafted history assignment is another great example of that.  I think the paradata is especially valuable as a model for making this kind of assignment mesh with both student and faculty expectations about what an assignment should be which ties back to your discussion of the essay above. This assignment has potential to be an important bridge piece or entry point into digital pedagogy. You might connect it to other forms of reflective pedagogy, e.g., eportfolios.

## TEI Close Reading Exercise

While marking up text and annotation has long been a staple of digital humanities work, Beal's exercise does the necessary heavy lifting to make it clear how one could teach TEI, and the pedagogical value of a digitally informed close reading. This exercise demonstrates how exposing our research and teaching to the world (in this case, via a repository on Github) builds teaching capacity for the rest of us.

REBECCA: How does this example build teaching capacity for the rest of us?  Your account of assignment forking in the annotation of DAEA illustrates that capacity. Do you want to say that this is a good model for the beginner?  

## Every Three Minutes

REBECCA: Use form or request CC license.

Our teaching and research, when freed from the confines of an essay, can literally have a kind of algorithmic agency (what Mark Sample calls a ['bot of conviction']( https://medium.com/@samplereality/a-protest-bot-is-a-bot-so-specific-you-cant-mistake-it-for-bullshit-90fe10b7fbaa#.k7zhd3p6e)). Such a creature directly confronts the public with the past. Originally devised as a backdrop to a classroom lecture, the affordances of the online medium, of twitter-as-platform-for-building, are used to devastating effect in the regular monotony of an update, every three minutes. Zach Whalen has an excellent tutorial on how to make simple twitter bots at [http://www.zachwhalen.net/posts/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-with-google-spreadsheets-version-04/](http://www.zachwhalen.net/posts/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-with-google-spreadsheets-version-04/)

REBECCA: Can you add one more sentence that explains what to do with this in the classroom?  You imply, but it would be nice to explicitly state it.

## The Programming Historian, issue #152

[The Programming Historian team](http://programminghistorian.org) has long sought to make the processes of publication, peer review, of digital work in History, transparent and accountable. This thread in particular, with its thoughtful and wide-ranging discussion, which does not shy away from some hard truths shows a community of practice around digital pedagogy and capacity building wrestling with an issue in a way that is collegial, humble, and open. At the end of the thread, the discussion will continue with a workshop <https://digitalhistorymentorship.wordpress.com/>.

REBECCA: Please articulate the application for the reader.  What should I do with this as a teacher?

Digital pedagogy in history changes not just how we teach, but how we _do_, history - how we work on our own, with colleagues, with students, and with the public. All of these pieces are essays in the sense of _essayer_ to try, to experiment, to change the world a little bit.

REBECCA: Please move the above paragraph up to the end of your curatorial statement.
