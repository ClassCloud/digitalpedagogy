## CURATORIAL STATEMENT 

At its most basic, the term “gender,” as evidenced by the definition in the Oxford English Dictionary, which defines gender as “kind, sort,” and “sex, quality of being male or female,” is used to categorize and differentiate: that which is male, and that which is other (“Gender”). More than just a marker of essentialist difference, however, gender is a significant factor for developing affinity, forming alliances, and building community. It also marks bodies as targets of violence, whether female-presenting avatars in online spaces, or queer and trans bodies in physical spaces. 

“Gender,” as it is used in gender and sexuality studies, comes from the mid 20th-century work of psychologist John Money, who theorized gender as social and enacted sex roles, as opposed to biological sex roles assigned at birth. Money’s use of the term emphasizes difference, but recognizes the constructed and reinforced nature of that difference. Since then, this conception of gender has been developed, problematized, critiqued, and developed to move beyond gender binaries and include discussions of power (Ahmed, Davis), norms (Irigiray, Kristeva), queerness (Wittig, Halberstam, Edelman), performativity (Butler), racialization (Crenshaw, Anzaldua, Spillers, Mercer), labor (Boris, Parreñas, Nakamura, Haraway), and capital (Braidotti, Hennessy). Considering this breadth of scholarship, and the massive body of work associated with it, this keyword will not attempt to offer an exhaustive overview of digital pedagogy as it can be used to teach gender studies. Rather, this curatorial statement points out major concerns for teaching about gender in the contemporary networked context, while the curated list offers sample activities and methods to incorporate feminist praxis and gender critique into humanities courses. 

A digital pedagogy attuned to gender must be reflexive. It must be reflexive of our own genders, our gendered practice, the genders of our students, and the gendering that happens in the classroom. Both embodied gender and gendered practice dictate and create a structure within which the politics of the classroom community play out. As with the tools and texts integrated into a class, none of these are neutral. Using digital pedagogy, in many ways, makes assumptions of students, assumptions about access, education, and inclination. Such a practice is fraught with doubled expectations, exceptions, and imperatives for all parties involved. As Alexis Lothian notes in her curatorial statement of the keyword “Sexuality,” “Classes in gender and sexuality bring together students for whom the recognition of hard-won identities feels like a matter of life and death, along with those who think that their normative gender and heterosexual identifications mean that a class on sexuality will teach them much about others and little about themselves.” Such a process, though, as Lothian points out, is a difficult and fraught one, and few people ever feel “safe” in such spaces, no matter how hard instructors may work to provide such a space. 

In my own classes, whether I am teaching Asian American literature, or digital textuality, I purposefully weave gender studies analysis into the study of history, literature, canon formation, or broader interdisciplinary humanities topics through the careful selection of primary texts for analysis and through in-class activities. This gives students a more nuanced understanding of specific contexts, of situated knowledge that comes from different experiences, and are informed by disparate subject positions. At the same time, I ask students to be conscious of their own identities, privileges, expectations, and to question where these come from. Such questions ask students to interrogate their long-held beliefs, question how those beliefs were formed, and puts pressure on assumptions about the neutrality of text or tool. Are their texts really epitomes of genius regardless of gender, race, and class? What privilege does the very act of writing, of coding, of tinkering speak to? Such questions are common to the humanities, but digital practices can expand scope of examination to tools, texts, and environments that students are immersed in on a daily basis. 

With this wide-ranging capacity in mind, the artifacts brought together here offer a series of resources, from simpler drop-in exercises with low time commitment and prep, to larger modules exploring gender, to extensive semester-long experiments in distributed feminist pedagogy, a pedagogy that strives to be emancipatory, non-hierarchical, transparent - one that advances social justice. Each artifact is, or has been, the labor of feminists committed to addressing the historical phallogocentricism and heteronormativity of our disiplines. 



## CURATED ARTIFACTS 

##Drop-In Activities 

###"Digitizing Chinese Englishmen"
*Artifact Type: Digital Archive

*Creator and Affiliation: Adeline Koh (Stockton University)

An early-stage project, Digitizing Chinese Englishmen is a project to digitize and archive the Straits Chinese Magazine, a journal published by diasporic Chinese in Southeast Asia at the turn of the 20th century. The project offers glimpses into colonial Southeast Asia through primary texts. These texts, though limited at the moment, are valuable resources for teaching about gender as it relates to colonialism, imperialism, and race, as the “Victorian Chinesemen” at the heart of the publication present a complex portrait of masculinity and precarious power in Imperial Britain. The decolonial imperative of the project can be used to train students in comparative analysis in courses on British Empire. Students can gain valuable experience in digitizing, markup, critical annotation and digital project maintenance. Director of the project, Koh suggests using the archive's texts to update traditional close reading assignments: "get students to do a close reading on one of the journal pieces studying victorian forms of masculinity, like a victim of chap ji ki (gambling)--the point of the story is that gambling leads to insanity and death." This  exercise builds on skills students are already learning in their class, but it broadens the canon and thus allows students to interrogate the production of gender and race within the British Empire. 

KDH: WHILE ALL OF THESE ARCHIVES ARE IMPORTANT AS SITES OF MATERIALS, WE’RE REALLY LOOKING FOR THE PEDAGOGICAL MATERIAL. IN SOME OF YOUR ARTIFACTS, YOU MAKE A RECOMMENDATION ABOUT HOW TO USE IT AS AN ASSIGNMENT, BUT WE REALLY NEED THAT ASSIGNMENT RATHER THAN A FEW LINES WITH A SUGGESTION. IT HELPS THOSE WHO WILL READ THROUGH THIS KEYWORD IF THEY CAN DOWNLOAD AND RE-MIX ASSIGNMENTS IMMEDIATELY (SOMETIMES WITH GRADING RUBRICS OR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS). FOR ANY THAT YOU HAVE INCLUDED HERE WITH THE SUGGESTED ASSIGNMENT, CAN YOU FIND AN ACTUAL ASSIGNMENT THAT SOMEONE HAS WRITTEN UP? THE IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS ARTIFACTS IS THE PEDAGOGICAL INSTRUCTIONS RATHER THAN THE INSPIRATION FOR CLASS DISCUSSION/READINGS.


###"Regender”
*Artifact Type: Web tool

Regender is a web-based tool designed to perform what the developer calls a “gender hack” on existing websites. Specifically, it highlights the use of gender pronouns in  English-language sites by switching those pronouns. This is a simple tool for revealing bias, and for opening up space to unpack gender binaries. Additionally, Regender exposes what Jill Walker Rettberg calls “technological filters” (tools that allow people to control their self-expression online) and “cultural filters” (“norms, expectations, normative discursive strategies” that influence behavior) that shapes daily life online. This tool reveals how code can be used to challenge built-in assumptions of the web and the cultural values expressed in web content. Regender is not perfect and can be buggy, but its flaws (difficulty in determining gender in some cases) also make it good example for discussions of algocentrism. A low-key exercise that can be done with the tool is to ask students to search for a specific person (e.g. Hillary Clinton or Beyonce) and then have them explain the search results that are returned with the subject's gender reversed or "hacked.” Students can then be asked to write a paper or reflect in a blog entry about the hidden gender bias that is made visible through the tool. 


###"Fat, Ugly or Slutty"
*Artifact Type: Website, blog
*Screenshot: “FatUglyorSlutty.png”
*Source URL: [http://fatuglyorslutty.com/](http://fatuglyorslutty.com/)
*Artifact Permissions: Copyright Fat, Ugly or Slutty
*Creator and Affiliation: Writers working under pseudonyms

One of the truths of the Internet is that given the chance, people will be trolls. Most often, they will troll those who do not present as heteronormative, cisgender (white) men. Fat, Ugly or Slutty is a blog that archives the harassment female gamers receive from other (mostly male) gamers, and draws attention to the rampant sexism and rape culture that has become a part of gamer culture. The site itself documents the very gender-specific harassment that women gamers tend to receive. The site is a user-created platform for community building, raising awareness, and it offers a store of primary materials for everyday analysis. A sample pedagogical use of this site includes asking students to choose a post category (e.g.“Crudely Creative” to “Unprovoked Rage”) and perform rhetorical analysis of the collected posts for recurring tropes, language, images. Ask student to evaluate both the harrassing content and responses. Some questions to consider asking students as they evaluate the primary texts: What are the assumptions informing the interactions? How are bloggers holding trolls accountable? 


###“Trans Women and the New Hypertext” 
*Artifact Type: Article
*Screenshot: “LambdaLiterary.png”
*Source URL: [http://www.lambdaliterary.org/features/07/08/trans-women-the-new-hypertext/](http://www.lambdaliterary.org/features/07/08/trans-women-the-new-hypertext/]
*Artifact Permissions: Copyright Lambda Literary
*Creator and Affiliation: Merrit Kopas, in Lambda Literary

Merritt Kopas, multimedia artist and game designer, writes about independent games with trans narratives. Kopas argues, “hypertext and digital games are totally trans genres”, and she offers a sampling of games produced by trans women who trouble binary gender constructions. The games shared in this article are diverse in subject matter, form, and genre, offering nuanced, first person narratives that interrogating the themes of family, embodiment, love, sex, pleasure and pain. Whether incorporated in literature or gender studies courses, these games broaden the canon of women’s fiction, science fiction, games studies, or electronic literature. In addition, these texts ask students and teachers to engage with texts in a different manner, by immersing themselves in the role of another by making choices that can change the outcome of the narrative. The subtle effects, the excitement or poignancy elicited can be profoundly effective for communicating the trans experience, or complicating the heteronormative one.


###Modules

###"Chicana Por Mi Raza"
*Artifact Type: public humanities project, digital archive
*Screenshot: "ChicanaPorMiRaza.png”
*Source URL: [http://www.chicanapormiraza.org](http://www.chicanapormiraza.org)
*Artifact Permissions: Anyone may use the archive and ancillary materials so long as they agree to join the Chicana por mi Raza Digital Memory Collective. According to the site, “Members of the collective are granted access to the materials in the collection with the understanding that they will contribute in some way to the goals of the Chicana por mi Raza project.”
*Creator and Affiliation: María Cotera and Linda Garcia Merchant in collaboration with The Institute for Computing in Humanities Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.

Chicana Por Mi Raza is a digital archive of Chicana feminism spanning 1965 to 1985. The collective has recorded over fifty-nine oral histories and gathered roughly 2500 documents, 60 percent of which have been digitized and cataloged. The collection includes a range of materials chronicling Chicana feminist theory and literature, including hours of oral history recordings, publications, notes, correspondences, photographs, newspaper clippings, and timelines.  This project is especially relevant for both K-12 and higher-ed classes in American Studies. Use the archive for  "filling the gap" activity and ask students to search for existing online timelines and US history narratives of the 1960s - 1980s. Then task students with identifying gaps in those accounts and fill them using material from the archive.  Using Timeline JS and writing original historical texts that incorporate interviews and primary materials from the archive. Modify requirements (use of digitized print texts, images, and information from interviews or profiles) to fit course objectives.

KDH: HERE TOO IN THIS SUB-SECTION; WE NEED THOSE ASSIGNMENTS TO HELP OUR READERS GET INTO TEACHING YOUR KEYWORD

###"Situated Knowledges Map"
*Artifact Type: In-class Activity
*Screenshot: “FTNMap.png”
*Source URL: [http://femtechnet.org/docc/feminist-mapping/situated-knowledge-map/](http://femtechnet.org/docc/feminist-mapping/situated-knowledge-map/)
*Artifact Permissions: Open Access
*Creator and Affiliation: FemTechNet: TL Cowan, K. Surkan, and Laura Wexler

According to FemTechNet the "Situated Knowledges Map is an experiment in thinking about the relationship between space, place, mobility and knowledge production and circulation. By marking locations of significance to ourselves, we hope to get a sense of where we are coming from across the FemTechNet world." The assignment page includes a bibliography and uses Google Maps Engine to create a collaborative map where students drop annotated pins with reflections about the place with particular emphasis to how the place helped the individual come to understand keywords such as "power, class, gender, sex, assigned sex, race" or "migrant knowledges". The mapping activity hacks a commercial mapping platform for transformative and collective knowledge production works to link learning that is occurring in geographically disparate locations, while the collective mapping encourages participants to engage with the situated of knowledge of others. 


###Twine Game
*Artifact Type: Assignment Prompt

*Source URL: [http://www.digitalrhetoriccollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Einstein-Vetter-Twine-Game-Assignment-.pdf](Einstein & Vetter Twine Game Assignment)
*Artifact Permissions: 
*Creator and Affiliation: Sarah Einstein and Matthew Vetter

This assignment was designed as a capstone to a larger unit on the politics and rhetoric of the #Gamergate controversy. It asked students to create their own choose-your-own adventure game that engaged "gender politics, identity, and narrative in the writing classroom" using the open-source Twine gaming engine. Students are asked to propose a game that addresses a social issue related to the course, perform research and produce an annotated bibliography, then to develop a game in groups. The purpose of the assignment was to create a narrative that revealed the complexity of a gender related issue (the students in Einstein and Vetter's course tackled street harassment, coming out as queer, and campus sexual assault) in the text where the player could make choices and reach differnt outcomes that can be negative, positive, or neutral. The assignment forces students to evaluate and inform their own understandings of the chosen topics and the surrounding social environment, reflect on potential dangers or opportunities, and determine how to present these to a general audience.


###"Feminist Wiki-storming"
*Artifact Type: Activity
*Screenshot: “FTNwikistorming.png”

*Artifact Permissions: CC BY-NC 2.0
*Creator and Affiliation: Adrianne Wadewitz, Veronica Paredes, and FemTechNet Wikistorming Committee

For several years now, feminist Wikipedians, led initially by Adrianne Wadewitz, have been organizing edit-a-thons to training women, queer communities, and people of color to edit Wikipedia to address gender and racial bias present among Wikipedians, who, according to a survey conducted by the Wikimedia Foundation, are overwhelmingly young, male, and white. Before her death, Wadewitz had worked with the WikiEd Foundation and FemTechNet to develop the assignments and teaching materials collected here. This includes rationale, learning objectives, types of assignments (ranging evaluating and copy editing of articles, to adding feminist scholarship to existing content, and creating new pages), an assignment builder, and tutorials. Wikipedia works best in longer scaffolded assignments, and over time students can becOme active participants in feminist Wikipedia editing projects, or at the very least learn to critique Wikipedia articles for gender bias.  

KDH: THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTION! HOWEVER, RATHER THAN SENDING READERS TO A MASS OF MATERIAL, CAN YOU CHOOSE 1 TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THIS ARTIFACT AND THEN SEND THEM TO THE BIG ARCHIVE WITHIN THE ARTIFACT RATIONALE? 

##Semester-long Feminist Pedagogical Experiments

###"FemTechNet DOCC: Dialogues on Feminism and Technology"
*Artifact Type: Syllabus
*Screenshot: “FemTechNetDOCC.png”

FemTechNet describes itself as “an activated network of scholars, artists, and students working on, with, and at the borders of technology, science, and feminism in a variety of fields including Science & Technology Studies (STS), Media and Visual Studies, Art, Gender, Queer, and Ethnic Studies.” The network’s biggest accomplishment includes a Distributed Open Collaborative Course (DOCC), developed as a critique of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Course). The Balsamo and Paredes syllabus from the New School is one of the early iterations (more sample syllabi can be found in the FTN Critical Race and Ethnic Studies Pedagogy Workbook). This syllabus is an example of a nodal DOCC course and offers an example of ways to incorporate digital learning activities in a semester-long course about gender, feminism and technology. The syllabus exemplifies a connected course that uses the networks materials: video dialogues and networked learning activities including keyword videos and Wikistorming.

 
###“Course Guide for Sociology of Gender”
*Artifact Type: Web page, teaching resources, Pinterest collections

The Sociological Images is a section of The Society Pages, an open-access social science project from the Department of Sociology at the University of Minnesota, curated by Lisa Wade (Occidental College). In Sociological Images, Wade shares a collection of resources to help teach and build analytical skills, in particular “sociological imagination.” The materials gathered include a sociological blog; a Pinterest board that curates over 14,500 images from advertisements, pop culture, and other visual culture with blog-length analyses and discussions; course guides; and more. Amongst these resources, Mary Nell Trautner's expansive "Course Guide for Sociology of Gender" is an especially helpful resource that collects important Society Pages posts that can help teach gender studies. The collection follows the general structure of a sociology course on gender and includes pages organized thematically around such topics as the social construction of gender or intersexuality and current topics such as gender in sports and white privilege.
