## CURATORIAL STATEMENT

As conversations about writing and digital technology began to expand in the 1990s, one of the things that quickly became clear to teachers was that our classrooms had always been multimodal. The physical spaces we teach in are necessarily rich with physical objects, sounds and smells that impact our learning. From a Cultural-Historical Activity Theory perspective, our daily interactions with spaces, tools, objects and artifacts is a critical aspect of any investigation of composing practices (see Prior et al.). Rather than a focus on 
"writing" or "composing" as a thing which happens only in the mind of the writer, we need to attend to literate practices in all of their complexity, as long chains and wide networks where tools and people and institutions interact over time and space. In my own work as a teacher and a Writing Program Administrator, I have been interested in thinking carefully and specifically about how complex literate activities (the things writers actually do when they are writing) work to shape both our knowledge and experience as writers and the genres of writing we produce and disseminate. "Classroom," therefore, becomes a term that encompasses much more than four walls and some seating in a building somewhere, or the digital interface of a course management system as it shapes the learning in an online-only classroom. 
 
From the point of view of teachers, the classroom, whether real or virtual, is a space where (ideally) learning happens. It is also a space that includes a wide range of physical and digital objects that have much more impact on our teaching practices than we tend to consider. The divide between our digital and physical classrooms has also become blurred by the fact that physical classrooms are permeated with digital technologies, while our "distance" learning spaces are digitally mediated in ways that are becoming ever more naturalized as commonplace ways that people interact (instant messaging, video chats, emails, etc.).

From the point of view of this collection of key terms, Classroom is a term that connotes a “learning space,” but as Ewan MacIntosh notes (see below), "learning doesn’t happen only in classrooms" (n. pag.). So if we are interested in learning spaces, then we need to follow the trail of where and how learning activities happen in the world.
 
In this curated collection I have brought together a handful of resources that cross boundaries between digital and physical classrooms and which may help us to think about not just the tools we use when we compose and learn (whether digital or physical), but how the spaces where we compose and learn (whether in school or outside of it) shape our productions and the ways we understand ourselves as literate citizens.

* **Physical Classroom Design and Its Impacts on Learning**: This group of resources was interesting to me because it follows mostly K-12 teachers and their understanding of “their” classrooms as spaces that need to have physical attributes that encourage learning. In post-secondary education settings, teachers do not have classroom spaces where they stay all day, so the focus on learning environments becomes much more institutionalized, and the focus on learning technologies comes to the forefront.
* **Designing Technology Infused Classrooms**: For both K-12 and college settings, new ideas for classroom design often (almost always, actually) need to include some concept of how digital technology will be accommodated, even if it is only how many outlets will be provided and how strong the wireless internet signal will be. So this group of resources focuses specifically on the idea of including technology into school learning spaces.
* **Attending to Space and Activity**: It seemed important to me to include a resource to help users think about the bigger picture of attending to space and activity in learning. For me, this moves beyond thinking about just classrooms or learning spaces in academia or about the use of technology in those spaces. It more about a recognition that when we compose we are embedded within complex networks of activity that are widely distributed, both temporally and geographically. So when we think about learning, we need to think about these networks, which reach out beyond both classroom walls and digital course management systems.
* **Classroom Tools for Composing**: These kinds of resources are embedded among many of the other terms in this collection. However, it felt right to me to provide a couple of links to resources that offer lists of digital tools that teachers can use to enhance learning.  In my work as a writing program administrator, I have found that often the first mental step instructors need to make when they begin to shift toward a view of the classroom as a hybrid, networked space, is to think about daily learning activities that can be enhanced by the use of different kinds of tools and technologies. So these basic links offers food for thought in these areas.

## CURATED ARTIFACTS 

### Physical Classroom Design and Its Impacts on Learning

In this section I have gathered some links that are related to the design of physical classrooms. Interestingly, most of the resources I found that focused on helping instructors think about physical classroom spaces were discussions of K-12 classrooms. However, I have also included one resource (an edited collection of articles) that focuses on learning spaces in higher education.

#### Scholastic Resources article on Organizing the Physical Classroom Space

This link is interesting because it offers advice about thinking about the physical space of classrooms. In particular, the connection between the teacher and the space is interesting because it implies that teachers have control over their classroom spaces and can use that control to impact learning.

There are currently only two entries included in this larger blog that focuses on a wide range of K-12 teaching issues. But these two examples show how creatively some teachers are able to think about the spaces where their students learn.

This edited collection of articles, published by Educause, is available as a free PDF. It offers a look at the issues of physical classroom design in university settings.

### The Impact of Classroom Design On Student Learning

The first of these links is an article that offers an overview of a study (which is the 2nd link) that found that differences in physical environments had a measurable impact on student learning. The study operationalized components related to aspects of the environment such as air quality and light as well as issues such as available stimulation and flexibility of learning space.

### Designing Technology Infused Classrooms
The following links focus on how technology can be used to enhance classroom learning, but the sites I’ve selected don’t just focus on technological tools.  Instead, they try to get a holistic view of all of the spaces where learning can/might/should happen and what kinds of tools (composing tools, furniture, lighting) impact that learning.

I really just loved this historic piece, which discusses the evolution of writing as a human activity. As someone who focuses on literate activity, the story of how our use of literacy tools has evolved is always compelling to me. It also reminds me that when we think about writing technologies, we can think across thousands of years.

The following course plan is designed for a course that takes activity theory and learning spaces as its two key themes. The course content is designed for an upper level undergraduate or graduate course, but the readings and projects could be adapted for courses from First Year Writing to various kinds of upper level and graduate level pedagogy courses. The readings for this course offer a much clearer articulation of the connection between activity theory and how it can help us to consider the complex ways people learn in various environments. It also includes an additional reading list.

### Classroom Tools for Composing (print and digital)
Although this topic is also addressed by curators of other keywords, I wanted to include at least a couple of links to pages that offer different software tools instructors can use to create more technology-infused learning.  For many teachers whose classrooms include either school-sponsored computing (desktop, laptop, tablet or other technologies) or student-driven computing (which can include all of the above as well as cell phones), these digitally mediated learning spaces must be considered as part of their classroom designs.  The following sites offer some interesting lists of different tools for instructors to consider:

From the National History Education Clearinghouse, this site offers a great range of different computer technologies that instructors can used.  When considered within the framework of “how does this technology impact the activity of learning,”  the various tools become an interesting part of any instructors considerations of the kind of classroom environment they are working to create.
