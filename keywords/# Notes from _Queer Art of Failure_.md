# Notes from _Queer Art of Failure_

- 1-2 "This book [...] [2] loxes the idealism of hope in order to gain wisdom and a new, spongy relation to life, culture, knowledge, and pleasure."


 - 2-3 "Under certain circumstances failing, losing, forgetting, unmaking, undoing, unbecoming, not knowing may in fact offer more creative, more cooperative, more surprising ways of [3] being in the world. Failing is something queers do and have always done exceptionally well [...] and it can stand in contrast to the grim scenarios of success that depend upon 'trying and trying again.' In fact if success requires so much effort, then maybe failure is easier in the long run and offers different rewards."


- 3 "What kinds of reward can failure offer us? Perhaps most obviously, failure allows us to escape the punishing norms that discipline behavior and manage human development with the goal of delivering us from unruly childhoods to orderly and predictable adulthoods. Failure preserves some of the wondrous anarchy of childhood and distrubs the supposedly clean boundaries between adults and children, winners and losers. And while failure certainly comes accompanied by a host of negative affects, such as disappointment, disillusionment, and despair, it also provides the opportunity to use these negative affects to poke holes in the toxic positivity of contemporary life."




- 14 "While the 'good' teacher leads his students along the pathways of rationality, the 'ignorant schoolmaster' must actually allow them to get lost in order for them to experience confusion and then find their own way out or back around."
- 23 "I begin by addressing the dark heart of the negativity that failure conjures, and I turn from the happy and productive failures explored in animation to darker territories of failure associated with futility, sterility, emptiness, loss, negative affect in general, and modes of unbecoming."
- 24 "All in all, this is a book about alternative ways of knowing and being that are not unduly optimistic, but nor are they mired in nihilistic critical dead ends."
- 88 "capitalism, as Scott Sandage argues in his book _Born Losers: A History of Failure in America (2005)_, requires that everyone live in a system that equates success with profit and links failure to the inability to accumulate wealth even as profit for some means certain losses for others. "
- 96 "For Crips, as for an artist such as Andy Warhol, failure presents an opportunity rather than a dead end"
- 186 "Queerness offers the promise of failure as a way of life [...] but it is up to us whether we choose to make good on that prmoise in a way that makes a detour around the usual markers of accomplishment and satisfaction."
- 174 Halberstam describes her goal: "...but rather than take failure apart, as I have tried to do i this book, as a category levied by the winners against the losers and as a set of standards that ensure that all future radical ventures will be measured as cost-ineffective...."
