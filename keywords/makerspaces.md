>Makerspaces are community-oriented places in which an ethos of do-it-yourself (DIY) experimentation with new technologies and materials coalesces with the goals of sharing knowledge and do-it-with-others (DIWO) collaborations on projects. They are spaces in which high and low tech are combined, where computing and crafting can be combined - where a 3D printer might share counter space with a sewing machine, a touchscreen and stylus with sketch paper and charcoal pencil, and where tools serving the space could include wire cutters and fabric scissors, soldering filament and Mod Podge, as well as broad range of micro-sensors, lights, and motors, various kinds of wood and metal, safety glasses and reciprocating saw . As a sign of the eclecticism of many makerspaces, it is not uncommon to find a white board covered in anything from technical diagrams, storyboarded drawings, and lines of code, to poetic verse, mathematical equations, and wireframe mockups. They are spaces in which the historic division between the sciences and the humanities, which C.P Snow once characterized as the “two cultures,” are increasingly blurred. Related to the goals of sharing knowledge, makerspaces promote the ideals of the open software and hardware movements; the right to copy is always toward the left, i.e., toward the public domain.


> Makerspaces can be found across the Americas, Europe, and in a growing number of locations in Asia and Africa. They are established in residential garages, community centers, schools, libraries, and museums. While there may be presently over 100 makerspaces in name across the world, when they are combined with hackerspaces or hack labs, fab(rication) labs, TechShops, and Men’s Sheds, which all share a related mission, their numbers grow into the thousands. Some proponents of the maker movement with which makerspaces are associated, argue that its practitioners are engaging in industrial revolution – one in which desktop computing technologies and the web contribute to a shared and open approach to micro-manufacturing (Anderson).


> The philosophical and counter-cultural origins of makerspaces can be traced back to the late-1960s when publisher and author Stewart Brand helped popularize the ideal of hacker culture. In the late-1960s, hackers were promoted by Brand as a burgeoning techno-elitist class of creatives and ‘outlaw’ experimentalists. It is for this reason that makerspaces are considered an off-shoot of the hackerspaces and hack labs that preceded them in name. More recently, makerspaces are associated with maker culture and the Maker Movement, which since 2005, have been promoted by bimonthly periodical Make Magazine and the Maker Faires associated with them. Make Magazine has promoted a culture of DIY and DIWO project development by featuring hundreds of projects in its print magazine and website, publishing step-by-step technical guides, a “skill builder” section for learning everything from how to operate a laser cut wood, sew leather with an awl, or 3D print objects, to name a few.  


> While makerspaces were started outside of a formal, educational context, the informal, DIY approach to learning, the DIWO approach to project development, and the ethos of the bricoleur that is exemplified by the wide range of tools, technologies, and materials comprising these spaces, have been increasingly valued by academics – as well as have the ways in which makerspaces point toward new, interdisciplinary configurations (Rosenfeld Halverson and Sheridan). Extending Stephen Ramsay’s argument about the essential role of “building” in digital humanities work, makerspaces participate in a similarly novel “kind hermeneutic of – one that is quite a bit more radical than taking the traditional methods of humanistic inquiry and applying them to digital objects” (On Buil).

> The WAAG Society is a grassroots organization devoted to participatory action projects, working toward social improvement through art, research, and development. Their FabLab (short for fabrication laboratory) in Amsterdam offers equipment and support for a variety of maker projects to businesses, schools, and individuals. The WAAG FabLab offers access to industrial grade equipment, curates a digital collection of projects with technical documentation accessible to the community, and offers hands-on workshops. As part of the larger [international community of FabLabs](http://www.fabfoundation.org/fab-labs/what-is-a-fab-lab/) held in charter by MIT faculty, the FabLab is considered “a place to play, to create, to learn, to mentor, to invent” with an emphasis on entrepreneurial endeavors, especially in local communities.

> Bringing tinkering to the masses, the Tinkering Studio in the Exploratorium, the museum of science, art, and human perception in San Fransisco, offers ”entry level” making projects via e-textiles, paper circuits, light painting, toy deconstruction and more. The Tinkering Studio brands itself as a space for constructivist learning, engaging museum visitors in hands-on experiences regardless of age or skill level. Beyond its branding, many makerspaces have adopted ideas and projects from The Art of Tinkering, written by the curators and facilitators of the Tinkering Studio, for hands-on gateway projects to entice people into spaces.

> Issue 13 of the journal Hyperrhiz, themed “Kits, Plans, and Schematics,” curated nine projects that combined DIY maker culture with humanities scholarship. These projects were later displayed in an exhibit at Rutgers University-Camden Digital Scholarship Center, inviting visitors to engage with the projects, while Hyperrhiz hosts the open access documentation and guides for others to explore, build, play, and modify. The combined publication and exhibit represented one answer to questions surrounding the navigation of traditional scholarly publications and project-based digital scholarship.
