## CURATORIAL STATEMENT

Makerspaces are community-oriented places in which an ethos of do-it-yourself (DIY) experimentation with new technologies and materials coalesces with the goals of sharing knowledge and do-it-with-others (DIWO) collaborations on projects. They are spaces in which high and low tech are combined, where computing and crafting can be combined - where a 3D printer might share counter space with a sewing machine, a touchscreen and stylus with sketch paper and charcoal pencil, and where tools serving the space could include wire cutters and fabric scissors, soldering filament and Mod Podge, as well as broad range of micro-sensors, lights, and motors, various kinds of wood and metal, safety glasses and reciprocating saw . As a sign of the eclecticism of many makerspaces, it is not uncommon to find a white board covered in anything from technical diagrams, storyboarded drawings, and lines of code, to poetic verse, mathematical equations, and wireframe mockups. They are spaces in which the historic division between the sciences and the humanities, which C.P Snow once characterized as the “two cultures,” are increasingly blurred. Related to the goals of sharing knowledge, makerspaces promote the ideals of the open software and hardware movements; the right to copy is always toward the left, i.e., toward the public domain.

>MATT: nice intro. Two things: 1. Please add CP Snow to works cited; and 2. Please keep the "digital pedagogy in the humanities" context -- and particularly "the humanities" in mind. Ie., the keyword should include some exploration not just of makerspaces in generally, but more specifically makerspaces in the context of digital pedagogy in the humanities.

Makerspaces can be found across the Americas, Europe, and in a growing number of locations in Asia and Africa. They are established in residential garages, community centers, schools, libraries, and museums. While there may be presently over 100 makerspaces in name across the world, when they are combined with hackerspaces or hack labs, fab(rication) labs, TechShops, and Men’s Sheds, which all share a related mission, their numbers grow into the thousands. Some proponents of the maker movement with which makerspaces are associated, argue that its practitioners are engaging in industrial revolution – one in which desktop computing technologies and the web contribute to a shared and open approach to micro-manufacturing (Anderson).

>MATT: Again, great -- but can you relate it to the classroom here or in the ensuing paragraphs? What are the implications of this work and these spaces for humanities pedagogy? 

The philosophical and counter-cultural origins of makerspaces can be traced back to the late-1960s when publisher and author Stewart Brand helped popularize the ideal of hacker culture. In the late-1960s, hackers were promoted by Brand as a burgeoning techno-elitist class of creatives and ‘outlaw’ experimentalists. It is for this reason that makerspaces are considered an off-shoot of the hackerspaces and hack labs that preceded them in name. More recently, makerspaces are associated with maker culture and the Maker Movement, which since 2005, have been promoted by bimonthly periodical Make Magazine and the Maker Faires associated with them. Make Magazine has promoted a culture of DIY and DIWO project development by featuring hundreds of projects in its print magazine and website, publishing step-by-step technical guides, a “skill builder” section for learning everything from how to operate a laser cut wood, sew leather with an awl, or 3D print objects, to name a few.  

>MATT: please add Brand to Works Cited. Please take another look at the last sentence here -- "how to operate a laser cut wood" should be reprased

>MATT: also: perhaps its important to include a reference to a work that critiques, or at least complicates/interrogates the hacker/maker/DIY construct? Perhaps *Fred Turner's [From Counterculture to Cyberculture](http://fredturner.stanford.edu/books/from-counterculture-to-cyberculture/)* could be helpful here.

While makerspaces were started outside of a formal, educational context, the informal, DIY approach to learning, the DIWO approach to project development, and the ethos of the bricoleur that is exemplified by the wide range of tools, technologies, and materials comprising these spaces, have been increasingly valued by academics – as well as have the ways in which makerspaces point toward new, interdisciplinary configurations (Rosenfeld Halverson and Sheridan). Extending Stephen Ramsay’s argument about the essential role of “building” in digital humanities work, makerspaces participate in a similarly novel “kind hermeneutic of – one that is quite a bit more radical than taking the traditional methods of humanistic inquiry and applying them to digital objects” (On Buil).

>MATT: please add all works mentioned here to the works cited. Please also correct your last parenthetical citation

>MAATT: Overall, this is a good introduction to makerspaces, but as mentioned above, I'd like to see more explicit connections to humanities classrooms. As a Curator's Statement, too, there should be some explanation of your principles of selection of the artifacts below. Why did you choose what you chose? 

## CURATED ARTIFACTS

>MATT: A few global notes on your selections: 1. We have recently instituted a requirement that at least two artifacts should be syllabi or assignments. Can you please add two such artifacts to your list (keeping the overall limit of 10)? 2. Your keyword is interesting, as it focuses on a type of space. But rather than offer the Lab itself as the artifact, I think it might be worthwhile to focus on a **specific** project in each location that you want to highlight, as the principle aim here is to give people ideas that they can use in our teaching. 3. Having said that, you may want to have a few entries where you focus specifically on space, and so the design/set-up of an entire lab might be important. If you want to go that way, perhaps include no more than three such listings. 4. You might consider grouping your entries into sub-categories, especially if "Spaces" is one of the categories you want to explore. 5. Finally, I that for each artifact below, clear connections to pedagogy should be made in each of the annotations. Again, the central question people should find answered is "How can I use this in my own teaching practice?"

Maker community sites are abundant (e.g. Arduino Playground, Instructables.com) to share, modify, and inspire. Adafruit Industries, founded by MIT engineer Limor Fried, is an online source for tutorials, guides, and other learning resources for electronics and other maker projects. The site also sells kits, materials, and components for a wide variety of projects ranging in skill level. Adafruit also partners with educators to provide resources and support to encourage making in the classroom at all levels of education.

>MATT: Again, what is the connection to humanities pedagogy? How might this be used in the classroom? 

## Hyperrhiz 13 & Rutgers-Camden Exhibit
![screenshot](images/makerspaces-hyperrhiz.png)

* Artifact Type: publication & gallery exhibition
* Source URL: http://hyperrhiz.io/hyperrhiz13/ & https://digitalstudies.camden.rutgers.edu/2015/10/05/hyperrhiz-kits-plans-and-schematics/
* Creator: Helen J. Burgess and David M. Rieder, eds.

Issue 13 of the journal Hyperrhiz, themed “Kits, Plans, and Schematics,” curated nine projects that combined DIY maker culture with humanities scholarship. These projects were later displayed in an exhibit at Rutgers University-Camden Digital Scholarship Center, inviting visitors to engage with the projects, while Hyperrhiz hosts the open access documentation and guides for others to explore, build, play, and modify. The combined publication and exhibit represented one answer to questions surrounding the navigation of traditional scholarly publications and project-based digital scholarship.

>MATT: This is good but just needs an additional sentence or two re pedagogy 

## The Foundry
