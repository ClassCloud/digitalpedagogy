## CURATORIAL STATEMENT

All at once, a map can be compelling, informative, and revealing, and usually non-threatening, save for those who experience anxiety when forced to navigate with one. Thus it is no surprise that maps in many forms may be found within instructional and research academic contexts, and a map is a familiar item within humanities disciplines. 

What is less familiar is geographical thinking as a whole, as well as mapping as a process. The absence of geography as a subject within formal school settings has contributed to a general lack of geographical thinking in the United States. Students and instructors alike are largely ill-prepared to read and interpret a map with confidence or competence, and this lack of preparation has implications for mapping as a pedagogical activity. An instructor models for students how to read a text deeply, with a critical and inquisitive eye towards ideas behind the words on the paper. Likewise, in many cases a map requires and merits consideration beyond the superficial observation of graphic patterns, yet there is uncertainty in this practice. 

From a teaching and learning perspective, assuming that the viewer will be able to read and interpret the map without directed guidance can be problematic. Having instructors prepared to pose thought-provoking questions of the map is one solution. But it could also be an issue with the map itself, that a particular arrangement of information has had unreasonable expectations imbued within. A map may meet its minimum criteria of being able to illustrate what, where, and perhaps when, but it is a leap of explanatory faith to assume that why and how can be intuited automatically by a viewer. Maps that independently tell a powerful story all on their own, as stand-alone narratives, are the exception rather than the rule. 

The type of maps that can most readily be generated with software such as a geographic information system (GIS) depict spaces that have a consistent scale throughout, are displayed from an overhead (planar) perspective, and portray information as representations of simple geometric shapes. They are designed for geometrically consistent spaces rather than representing nuanced "senses of place" (Cresswell 2004). Having realistic expectations for what experiences a digital map can support or provide is thus essential. 

An environmental scan of published humanities mapping projects shows a largely bimodal distribution of cases: big and complex projects, or small and simple ones, with fairly few in between. 

On the grand side, over the last decade a combination of vision, funding, and technical expertise have produced noteworthy and admirable projects in which spatial analysis and customized maps are central. Students may have been involved in the development activities, but addressing research questions was the primary motivation behind these efforts. Projects at this scope and scale require significant effort from a team of people with different types of technical expertise, as the mapping itself will involve just as much, if not more web programming as traditional map-making applications. Exciting and innovative examples can be found at Stanford’s Spatial History Project, the Keck Digital Cultural Mapping Program at UCLA, and the University of Virginia’s ScholarsLab. The American Association of Geographers maintains a list of history projects that have used GIS, Clearinghouse, as does the GeoHumanities organization. 

At the same time, a rise in DIY map-making applications and affiliated tutorials and workshops have made it easier than ever for people everywhere to produce simple maps and publish them online. One very common form is the "map mashup," the blending of user-contributed content - typically annotated point locations - over a Google Maps background. The Toronto Poetry Map, Placing Literature, or Digital Harlem's map are three of thousands of examples. The map becomes an organizational template, as well as an approach for search and discovery within what could otherwise be an uninteresting database of information. Still, without guidance for the exploration, the user can easily become distracted before insights, or learning outcomes, are achieved. 

Mapping and geographical thinking offer tremendous potential to enrich humanities studies and lines of inquiry.To increase the chances of satisfying outcomes and decrease the chances of frustration and being over- or under-whelmed, have the inquiry drive the data, and not the other way around. Experiment with low tech methods (paper and colored pencils) while the questions and data models are being developed. Be prepared to spend three times as much time as you had allocated, and be creative with learning outcomes and assessments to allow for exploring and accommodating the mixture of content-knowledge and technical-knowledge acquisition.  

The artifacts chosen here reflect materials and resources from individuals and groups who have put thoughtful ideas into having maps, and the acts of mapping, be a meaningful pedagogical tool and practice within their classroom. Examples built with open source and proprietary software are both included, though sometimes it may just be a digital copy of a single map, produced itself by traditional analog methods, that is the focus of an artifact. The intent is to suggest a range of types of pedagogical contexts and support that can make map usage and production a more meaningful educational experience.
